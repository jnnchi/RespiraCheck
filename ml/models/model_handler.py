"""Model Handler Module.

This module provides the `ModelHandler` class for managing the training, evaluation, 
and inference processes of a machine learning model. It also includes functionality 
for saving and loading models.

Dependencies:
    - PyTorch (torch)
    - CNNModel: A custom-defined neural network architecture.

TODO:
    - Implement training and evaluation logic.
    - Add error handling for model saving/loading.
    - Include device compatibility checks.
