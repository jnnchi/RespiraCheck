"""Model Pipeline Module.

This module provides the `ModelPipeline` class for handling the complete 
machine learning pipeline, including data preparation, model training, 
saving, and inference.

Dependencies:
    - Custom `DataPipeline` and `ModelHandler` classes.

TODO: - Implement data pipeline integration.
      - Define model training and inference logic.
